# Nixifying Hyperspace

In this toturial, we will **nixify** a serivce written in Rust
that is currently not being built with Nix, and show how we can
[compose this service with Arion](../composing-services-with-arion.md).

git clone git@github.com:ComposableFi/hyperspace

git checkout -b cor/nixify
